## Experimenting with Kafka

Few experiments using Kafka and Spark.
The aim is to process stream of data taken from Twitter and exploit Kafka's consumers for providing some insights:

 - CountingLang.scala: it counts the most popular languages from Twitter's users.
 - CountingSource.scala: it counts the most popular platform (iPhone, iPad, Android, Web etc).
 - CountingHashtags: it counts the most popular hashtags
